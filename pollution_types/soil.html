    <h1>Soil Pollution</h1>
    <p>Soil pollution is the presence of toxic chemicals, pollutants, or contaminants in high enough concentrations to be of risk to plants, wildlife, humans, and the soil itself. Within 40 years, estimated to be over 2 billion more people. This means that food production will have to increase as estimates say at least 40% and most of that needs to be grown on the fertile soils that cover just 11% of the global land surface. With that in mind, there is now little amount of new land that can be brought into production, and existing land is being lost and degraded because of pesticides, and global warming.</p>
    <p>The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization say that each year, 75 billion tons of soil, equals close to 10 million hectares, which is about 25 million acres, of land is lost to erosion, water-logging, and salinization, and another 20 million hectares are abandoned because its soil quality has been degraded. Contact with contaminated soil may be direct, from using parks, schools, and other outside things. You can also make contact with contaminated soil indirectly by inhaling soil contaminants that have vaporized in the air or through the consumption of plants or animals that have accumulated large amounts of soil pollutants. This may result in secondary contamination of water supplies and from deposition of air contaminants.</p>
    <h2>Causes of Soil Pollution</h2>
    <p>The repetitive, and increasing use of chemicals such as pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, and fertilizers is one of the major main factors causing soil pollution by increasing its salinity making crop's growth bearable in the soil. This affects the micro-organism in the soil, causing the soil to lose its natural fertility, which in turn loses the minerals that are present in the soil, thus causing soil pollution to kill off more than just the intended pest it was used for.</p>
    <p>Other types of soil contamination typically arise from radioactive fallout (nuclear bombs). The nuclear bombs can rupture underground storage tanks, contaminate surface water of subsurface strata, leaching of waste from landfills, or direct discharge industrial wastes into the soil. Other contaminants are harmful irrigation practices, improper septic system and management, maintenance leakages from sanitary sewage, acid rain falling onto the soil, and fuel leakages from automobiles that can get washed away due to rain and seep into the soil. Another thing that causes soil pollution is an unhealthy waste management technique. For example, these techniques are dumping sewage in large dumping grounds or nearby streams or rivers.</p>
    <h2>Effects of Soil Pollution</h2>
    <p>The effects of soil pollution have tons of harmful effects on the ecosystems includes human, plant, and animal health. As already stated these harmful effects of soil pollution can come from direct contact with polluted soil or from indirect contact. An example of indirect contact is water and food. Water and food sources could be grown on or come into direct contact with the polluted soil, which leads to the consumer of this polluted food or water to indirect contact.</p>
    <h3>Humans</h3>
    <p>Soil pollutants are carcinogenic causing humans who are exposed to these pollutants to have a higher chance of developing cancer than those who don’t have soil pollution. Soil pollution is known to also cause neuromuscular blockade as well as depression of the central nervous system, headaches, nausea, fatigue, eye irritation, and skin rash. Soil doesn’t need to be highly contaminated to be very harmful to humans. Soil that is not significantly polluted may still do damage to humans directly through bioaccumulation, which occurs when plants are grown in lightly polluted soil. This soil continuously absorbs molecules of pollutants, and plants can’t get rid of molecules in the soil. This means that it will accumulate in the soil causing higher amounts of pollution to exist in the plant than in the soil. </p>
    <p>Animals who eat many of these polluted plants take on all the pollution those plants have built up. Larger animals who eat the plant-eating animals take on all the pollution from the animals they eat. When humans eat meat and plants they get soil pollution indirectly. The more soil pollution that builds up the increased chance of being poisoned. Even if the soil itself doesn’t contain enough pollution to harm human health. Lead and mercury in the soil may also be harmful to human health. Although lead and mercury may be found naturally in the soil, a high concentration of either metal may cause damage to the developing brains of young children, which in other words lead to neurological problems. </p>
    <h3>Animals</h3>
    <p>For animals, soil pollution can negatively affect the metabolism of microorganisms and arthropods, which can destroy some layers of the primary food chain and have a harmful effect on predator animal species. Smaller life forms may consume harmful chemicals in the soil, which has the chance to be passed up the food chain to larger animals. This can lead to an increased mortality rate and could even lead to animal extinction.</p>
    <h3>Environment</h3>
    <p>Soil pollution naturally contributes to air pollution by releasing compounds into the atmosphere. This in mind the more toxic compounds soil contains, the greater the air pollution it creates. This also can lead to water pollution if toxic chemicals lead into groundwater or if contaminated runoff streams or sewage. This can lead to heavy metal, reaching streams, lakes, oceans. Applied repeated or in large amounts of these heavy metals can accumulate in soils to the point that it’s unable to support plant life. Soil pollution allows great quantities of nitrogen to escape through ammonia and denitrification and the decomposition.of organic materials in soil can release sulfur dioxide and other sulfur compounds, which leads to acid rain. </p>
    <p>Acidic soil created by the deposition of acidic compounds,  such as sulfur dioxide brought about by the burning of fossil fuel. An acidic environment harms microorganisms, which improve the soil structure by breaking down organic material and aiding in water flow. Soil pollution may alter plant metabolism and reduce crop yield and cause trees and plants that may absorb soil contaminants to pass them up the food chain. Soil polluted by acid has an impact on plants by disrupting the soil system and reducing the plant’s ability to take up nutrients.</p>
