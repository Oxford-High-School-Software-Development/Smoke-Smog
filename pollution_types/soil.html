    <h1>Soil Pollution</h1>
    <p>Soil pollution is the presence of toxic chemicals, pollutants, or contaminants in high enough concentrations to be of risk to plants, wildlife, humans, and the soil itself. Within 40 years, estimated to be over 2 billion more people. This means that food production will have to increase as estimates say at least 40% and most of that needs to be grown on the fertile soils that cover just 11% of the global land surface. With that in mind, there is now little amount of new land that can be brought into production, and existing land is being lost and degraded because of pesticides, and global warming.</p>
    <p>The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization say that each year, 75 billion tons of soil, equals close to 10 million hectares, which is about 25 million acres, of land is lost to erosion, water-logging, and salinization, and another 20 million hectares are abandoned because its soil quality has been degraded. Contact with contaminated soil may be direct, from using parks, schools, and other outside things. You can also make contact with contaminated soil indirectly by inhaling soil contaminants that have vaporized in the air or through the consumption of plants or animals that have accumulated large amounts of soil pollutants. This may result in secondary contamination of water supplies and from deposition of air contaminants.</p>
