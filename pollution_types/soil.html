    <h1>Soil Pollution</h1>
    <p>Soil pollution is the presence of toxic chemicals, pollutants, or contaminants in high enough concentrations to be of risk to plants, wildlife, humans, and the soil itself. Within 40 years, estimated to be over 2 billion more people. This means that food production will have to increase as estimates say at least 40% and most of that needs to be grown on the fertile soils that cover just 11% of the global land surface. With that in mind, there is now little amount of new land that can be brought into production, and existing land is being lost and degraded because of pesticides, and global warming.</p>
    <p>The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization say that each year, 75 billion tons of soil, equals close to 10 million hectares, which is about 25 million acres, of land is lost to erosion, water-logging, and salinization, and another 20 million hectares are abandoned because its soil quality has been degraded. Contact with contaminated soil may be direct, from using parks, schools, and other outside things. You can also make contact with contaminated soil indirectly by inhaling soil contaminants that have vaporized in the air or through the consumption of plants or animals that have accumulated large amounts of soil pollutants. This may result in secondary contamination of water supplies and from deposition of air contaminants.</p>
    <h2>Causes of Soil Pollution</h2>
    <p>The repetitive, and increasing use of chemicals such as pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, and fertilizers is one of the major main factors causing soil pollution by increasing its salinity making crop's growth bearable in the soil. This affects the micro-organism in the soil, causing the soil to lose its natural fertility, which in turn loses the minerals that are present in the soil, thus causing soil pollution to kill off more than just the intended pest it was used for.</p>
    <p>Other types of soil contamination typically arise from radioactive fallout (nuclear bombs). The nuclear bombs can rupture underground storage tanks, contaminate surface water of subsurface strata, leaching of waste from landfills, or direct discharge industrial wastes into the soil. Other contaminants are harmful irrigation practices, improper septic system and management, maintenance leakages from sanitary sewage, acid rain falling onto the soil, and fuel leakages from automobiles that can get washed away due to rain and seep into the soil. Another thing that causes soil pollution is an unhealthy waste management technique. For example, these techniques are dumping sewage in large dumping grounds or nearby streams or rivers.</p>
    <h2>Effects of Soil Pollution</h2>
    <p>The effects of soil pollution have tons of harmful effects on the ecosystems includes human, plant, and animal health. As already stated these harmful effects of soil pollution can come from direct contact with polluted soil or from indirect contact. An example of indirect contact is water and food. Water and food sources could be grown on or come into direct contact with the polluted soil, which leads to the consumer of this polluted food or water to indirect contact.</p>
