    <h1>Light Pollution</h1>
    <p>Light pollution is the excessive or inappropriate use of outdoor artificial light. Light pollution affects human health, wildlife behavior, and the ability to see stars and other celestial objects. Light pollution is a global issue. According to the <a href="https://www.lightpollutionmap.info/#zoom=5.23&lat=39.8241&lon=-73.0740&layers=B0FFFFFFFTFFFFFFFFFFF" id="text_links"> World Atlas of Night Sky Brightness</a> which is a computer-generated map of thousands of satellite photos, that was published in 2016. The Atlas shows how and where our globe is lit up at night. Some of the light pollution is in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Some of the most light-polluted countries in the world are Singapore, Qatar, and Kuwait. With this in mind, the most remote regions on Earth which are Siberia, Sahara, and the Amazon are in total darkness. </p>
    <p>Sky glow is the brightening of the night sky due to the electric light of cars, streetlamps, offices, factories, outdoor advertising, and buildings. People living in cities have a high level of sky glow which leads to a hard time seeing more than a handful of stars at night. According to astronomers they are particularly concerned with skyglow pollution as already stated it reduces their ability to view objects in space. More than 80 percent of the world’s population, and 99 percent of Americans and Europeans live under sky glow.</p>
    <h2>Affects on Humans</h2>
    <p>This artificial light can damage the natural body rhythms in both humans and animals. Nocturnal light interrupts sleep and confuses the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is the twenty-four-hour clock that guides day and night activities in all organisms. One of these processes of circadian rhythm is the production of hormone melatonin which is released when it's dark and is inhibited when there is light present. An increased amount of light at night lowers melatonin production which leads to sleep deprivation, fatigue, headaches, stress, anxiety, and other health problems not listed here. Recent studies also show a connection between reduced melatonin levels and cancer. New scientific discoveries about the health effects of artificial light have convinced the AMA (American Medical Association) to support effects to control and reduce light pollution. </p>
    <h3>Blue Light</h3>
    <p>Blue light has been shown to reduce levels of melatonin in humans. Blue light is found in cell phones and other computer devices. It's also found in LEDs (light emitting diodes), these kinds of bulbs have become popular for home use, industrial use, and city lights due to their lower cost and energy efficiency. </p>
    <h2>Effects on Animals</h2>
    <p>Studies show that light pollution is also impacting animal behaviors, such as migration patterns, wake-sleep habits, and habitat formation. Light pollution causes sea turtles to be confused about which way to go because they are often guided by moonlight. During the migration of these animals, they lose their way and often die. Large numbers of insects, a primary food source for birds and other animals, are drawn to artificial lights that kill them. Birds are also affected by this, and many cities have adopted a “Lights Out” program to turn off building lights during bird migration.</p>
    <p>Light pollution even in places meant to provide protected natural habitat for wildlife, light pollution is making an impact. NPS (The National Park Service) has made maintaining a dark night sky a priority. The NPS Night Skies Team has been monitoring dark night sky brightness in some one hundred parks, and nearly every park has shown at least some light pollution in it.</p>
    <h2>Dark Sky Reserve</h2>
    <p>There are multiple organizations working to reduce light pollution. One of these organizations is the U.S.-based IDA (International Dark Sky Association), formed in 1988 to preserve the natural night sky. The IDA educates the public and certifies parks and other places that have been working to reduce their light emission. In 2017, IDA approved the first U.S. dark sky reserve. The dark sky reserve is 1,416 miles long (3,667 square kilometers): the dark sky reserve is a large area of land that has no light in it. As of December 2018, IDA lists thirteen dark sky services on their site.</p>
