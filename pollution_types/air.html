    <h1>Air Pollution</h1>
      <p>Air Polluion is a mix of many harzardous substances, some man-made, namely the emmissions from burning coal, oil, and natural gas. However, others can be natural such as, smoke and ash from natural disasters and methane emitted via decomposing organic matter(although natural, it has been greatly enhanced by humanity).
     These human-made pollutants are increasing common in large and densely populated cities where humans are more industrialized. 
     Many contaminants can be traced back to car emissions and factories which have increased in the last century. 
      </p>
    <h2>Air Quaility</h2>
    <p>Air Quality is the main side affect of air pollution as harmful and dangerous pollutants can enter the air. 
      These toxins can both be debilitating and deadly for humans and are considered a major health threat by the WHO.</p>
      <h3>Smog</h3>
      <p>Smog(a combination of Smoke/Fog) is commonly seen as dark clouds found often in urban areas.
         Similar to haze, smog is a visible pollutant that obscures many skylines across highly polluted cities and areas.
        Although consisting of a wealth of gases and toxins smog's main tenant is Ozone</p>
      <h3>Ozone</h3>
      <p>Ozone is a common gas and a highly reactive form of oxygen.
        Although being found in the upper atmosphere and shielding earth from the ultraviolet rays of the sun, when at ground level ozone is considered quite harmful to humans.
        This gas is produced mainly by car emmissions and manufactuaring, and forms often due to heat, methane emmission and particulate matter concentrations.
        As global tempertures, rise ground level oxone is expected to increase the amount of premature deaths it causes and begin to cause worsening health among humans.
      </p>
      <h3>Carbon Monoxide</h3>
      <p>Carbon Monoxide(CO) is a colorless, tasteless, odorless gas found in urban areas.
         When enhaled through the lungs it will enter the blood stream and decreases the amount of oxygen in the body.
        It impairs the heart contractions which reduces a healthy person from exercising but also can be life-threatening to a heart disease patient.
        </p>
    <h2>Health effects</h2>
      <ul>
      <li><b>Asthma:</b>a chronic lung disease often caused or worsened by exposure to air pollutants</li>
      <li><b>Lung Cancer:</b>a long term effect of air pollution that can and generally leads to death</li>
      <li><b>Heart Disease:</b>a debilitating condidtion of the heart sometimes caused in part by airborne lead</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Climate Change</h2>
  <p>Climate change is harming human health by increasing ground-level ozone and particulate matter air pollution in some locations.
    Ground-level ozone (a key component of smog) is associated with many health problems, such as diminished lung function, increased hospital admissions, emergency room visits for asthma, and increases in premature deaths.
    The EPA determined in 2009 that emissions of carbon dioxide and other long-lived greenhouse gases that build up in the atmosphere endanger the health and welfare of current and future generations by causing climate change and ocean acidification.</p>
